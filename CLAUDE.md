# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Sittilingi SHG Portal — a Flutter mobile app (offline-first) paired with a FastAPI backend for SHG monthly bookkeeping used by SOFA field workers. Full product requirements and API spec are in `docs/solution-architecture.md`.

## Development commands

### Database (Docker)
```bash
docker compose up -d db        # PostgreSQL on localhost:5432
```

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate      # or: python3 -m venv .venv && pip install -e ".[dev]"
alembic upgrade head            # apply migrations
python seed.py                  # seed groups and sample entries
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # API at http://localhost:8000/docs
```

Run tests (use SQLite in-memory, no Docker needed):
```bash
cd backend && pytest
pytest tests/test_month_entry_flow.py::test_create_month_entry_marks_warning_status_when_totals_look_suspicious
```

### Flutter frontend
```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build    # regenerate drift local_db.g.dart
flutter run                           # default device
flutter run -d chrome                 # web
flutter run -d android
flutter test
```

## Architecture

### Data flow (offline-first)

Every entry is written **locally first** via Drift (SQLite on Android/iOS, IndexedDB on web). The `SyncService` then POSTs `pending_sync` entries to the FastAPI backend when the worker taps Sync. The key identifiers:

- `localId` — UUID generated on device, permanent primary key in the local DB
- `serverId` — populated only after a successful sync; null means not yet synced

### Flutter frontend (`frontend/lib/`)

**State management:** Riverpod. Two root providers live in `providers/shared_providers.dart` — `localDbProvider` (single `LocalDb` instance) and `apiClientProvider` (single `ApiClient`). Feature providers (`entriesProvider`, `groupsProvider`) are `AsyncNotifierProvider`s that read these.

**Navigation:** `go_router` declared in `main.dart`. Routes: `/login` → `/` (HomeScreen) → `/entries/new` → `/ledger/:groupId` → `/dashboard`.

**Local DB:** Drift schema in `database/local_db.dart`. After any schema change, run `build_runner build` to regenerate `local_db.g.dart`. The `_openConnection()` function at the bottom uses `driftDatabase(name: 'shg_portal')` — Drift picks the right executor (SQLite vs IndexedDB) per platform automatically.

**Warning logic is duplicated intentionally:** `entries_provider.dart::_buildWarnings()` mirrors `backend/app/services/validation.py::build_warning_flags()`. Both must stay in sync — the Flutter side shows live warnings while typing; the backend revalidates on save.

**API client:** `api/api_client.dart` uses Dio + `flutter_secure_storage` for JWT. The `baseUrl` defaults to `http://localhost:8000` — update `ApiClient()` instantiation in `shared_providers.dart` for production.

### Backend (`backend/app/`)

**Request path:** `main.py` → `api/router.py` → `api/v1/endpoints/{groups,month_entries,reports}.py`

- `api/deps.py` — yields SQLAlchemy `Session` via `Depends(db_session)`.
- `services/validation.py` — `build_warning_flags(entry)` + `derive_status()` called on every create/update.
- `core/config.py` — Pydantic-settings; reads `.env`. Key: `DATABASE_URL`, `CORS_ORIGINS`.
- The `month_entries` table has a unique constraint on `(group_id, entry_month)`.

**Tests** use SQLite in-memory (no Postgres needed). `conftest.py` seeds two Groups and a User, overrides `db_session`, and suppresses startup events.

**Auth** is not yet implemented — `users` table and `UserRole` enum exist but there is no login endpoint or JWT middleware.

### Auth design (to be built)

No sign-up flow. Users are created manually in the backend database by an admin.

**Online login:** POST credentials to `/api/v1/auth/login` → receive JWT → store in `flutter_secure_storage`. On success, immediately run an initial sync (download groups + entries from server into local Drift DB).

**Offline login:** compare entered password against a locally cached SHA-256 hash stored during the last successful online login. Offline login only works after at least one successful online login on that device.

**Critical assumption:** field workers must complete their first login from a location with internet (e.g. the SOFA office). This seeds the local DB with credential cache, groups, and entries. Without it, offline mode does not work.

On every subsequent online login the app re-syncs groups and entries to keep local data fresh.

### What's not built yet

- Auth / JWT login endpoint and middleware
- Initial sync (download) triggered on online login
- Local credential cache table in Drift for offline login
- AI image extraction (models defined, no service or upload endpoint)
- Flutter `flutter_secure_storage` on web requires additional setup (falls back to `localStorage`)
